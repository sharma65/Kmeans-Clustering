Project during the Spring 2017 semester at Rutgers University, for the Numerical Analysis class. This implements the K-means clustering algorithm for a set of data points.
MyKmeans is original and TestMyKmeans was mostly supplied, although some code had to be added such as the L^2 normalization and the plots of accuracy and time.
